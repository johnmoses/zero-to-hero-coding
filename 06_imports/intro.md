# Imports

Computer code is normally persisted or stored in files in the drives and loaded to the Random Access Memory (RAM) at runtime. Code from one file can be accessed in another file by means of the `import` statement. The code that we run from the interactive prompt is not persisted since it is not stored in the disk.

Python code are stored in `.py` files and are refered to as `modules` and further organized into packages. A large program is made up of many of this organizational structure.

## Importance of imports
- Code reuse
- Namespace partitioning
- Shared data and services
