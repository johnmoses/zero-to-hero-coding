# Strings

Text is a string data type. Generally any data type enclosed in single, double or tripple quotes is a string. Python provides both single line and multiline strings.

## Dates

Dates are special type of text string formatted to handle calendar components. A date in Python is not a data type of its own, but we can import a module named datetime to work with dates as date objects.
