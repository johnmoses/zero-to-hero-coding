# Expressions

An expression is a combination of operands and operators to produce results when evaluated. A simple example is shown below

```py
x = 1 + 1
print(x)
```

## Bolean Operators

A boolean data type represents on of the two values, `True` or `False`.

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic Operators are used for performing arithmetic operations including addidion, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, floor division and exponentiation.

## Comparison Operators

We use comparison operators to compare two values. We check if a value is greater or less or equal to other value.

## Logical Operators

## Bitwise Operators

## Operator Precedence

This show the preference the compiler has when more than one operator is used in an expression. In mathematics we use an acronym BODMAS(Bracket Of Division, Multiplication And Subtraction) while working on mathematical expressions.

The table below shows operators and their associativity

Binary ** Right
Unary +, -
Binary *, /, //, % Left
Binary +, - Left
Binary = Right
