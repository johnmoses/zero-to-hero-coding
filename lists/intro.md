# Lists in Python

There are four collection data types in Python. Their basic differences and similarities lies in orderliness, mutability and duplicity of members.

- List: is a collection which is ordered, mutable(modifiable) and allows duplicate members.
- Tuple: is a collection which is ordered, immutable and allows duplicate members.
- Set: is a collection which is unordered, immutable, and allows no duplicates. Also, new items can be added to the set.
- Dictionary: is a collection which is unordered, immutable, allows no duplicate members.

## List Comprehension

List comprehension in Python is a compact way of creating a list from a sequence. It is a short way to create a new list. List comprehension is considerably faster than processing a list using the _for_ loop.
