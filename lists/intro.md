# Lists in Python

There are four collection data types in Python

- List: is a collection which is ordered and changeable(modifiable). Allows duplicate members.
- Tuple: is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable or unmodifiable(immutable). Allows duplicate members.
- Set: is a collection which is unordered, un-indexed and unmodifiable, but we can add new items to the set. Duplicate members are not allowed.
- Dictionary: is a collection which is unordered, changeable(modifiable) and indexed. No duplicate members.
