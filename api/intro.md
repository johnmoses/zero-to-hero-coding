# Application Programing Interface (API)

Application Programming Interface (API) is a medium through which enterprises and applications expose their functionality for access by open systems. Interactions between the service provider and the receiver are further regulated by Service Level Agreement (SLA).

Another level is RESTful APIs. Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architecture that imposes conditions on how an API should work.

RESTful API is an interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet. It uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data stored in databases and web servers.

This architecture brings lots of benefits including scalability, flexibility and independence of applications.

A good example is Twitter's REST API allows developers to access core Twitter data and the Search API provides methods for developers to interact with Twitter Search and trends data
