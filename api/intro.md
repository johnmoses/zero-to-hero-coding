# Application Programing Interface (API)

RESTful API is an interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet. It uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.

Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architecture that imposes conditions on how an API should work.
This architecture brings lots of benefits including scalability, flexibility and independence of applications.
