# Classes and Object Oriented Programming

Everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods. A number, string, list, dictionary, tuple, set etc. used in a program is an object of a corresponding built-in class.

```py
# Define a class
class Apple:
    size = 3
```

## Classes

A class is a template for creating objects.

## Objects

Objects are instances of the class

## Operator Overloading

Operator overloading

## Composition

Composition allows us to reuse the implementation of another class

## Inheritance

Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.

Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.

Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

## Polymorphism

This allows methods to have the same name but behave differently based on the object’s context. It can be achieved through method overriding or overloading.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) within a class, restricting access to some components to control interactions.

A class typically encapulates public, private and protected members including functions and variables for various levels of visibility and access.

## Data Abstraction

This hides the internal implementation details while exposing only the necessary functionality. It helps focus on “what to do” rather than “how to do it.”
