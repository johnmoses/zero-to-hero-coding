# Classes and Object Oriented Programming

Everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods. A number, string, list, dictionary, tuple, set etc. used in a program is an object of a corresponding built-in class.

```py
# Define a class
class Apple:
    size = 3
```

## Classes

## Composition

## Inheritance

Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.

Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.

Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

## Objects

## Operator Overloading

## Garbage Collection
