# Networks

Python network modules provide two levels of access to system network infrastructure namely:

- Low-Level Access through sokets
- High-Level Access through HTTP, FTP and other protocols

## Sockets

Consider a bidirectional communication channel, the sockets are the endpoints of this communication channel. These sockets (endpoints) can communicate within a process, between processes on the same machine, or between processes on different machines. Sockets use different protocols for determining the connection type for port-to-port communication between clients and servers.
