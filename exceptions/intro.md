# Exceptions

When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and generate an error message.

## Blocks in exception statement

- The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.
- The except block lets you handle the error.
- The else block lets you execute code when there is no error.
- The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.
