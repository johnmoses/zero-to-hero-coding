# Files

Data is usually stored in different file formats(.txt, .json, .xml, .csv, .tsv, .excel).

Handling these files involves creating, reading, updating or deleting as required. Below are some of the notations:

- "r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, it returns an error if the file does not exist
- "a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist
- "w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist
- "x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists
- "t" - Text - Default value. Text mode
- "b" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)
